# cruising-across-canada

With most people isolated and alone in their homes, it’s always a good idea to remind ourselves of the amazing country we live in, with its unique features, 
landscapes, and individuals. This is why we created a fun trivia game called “Cruising Across Canada”, where your Canadian knowledge is put to the test! 
This game is designed to keep our country at its core as you take a roadtrip across Canada and pick up new facts about each province and territory. 

While designing “Cruising Across Canada,” we wanted to showcase fun facts that Canadians might not know about their surrounding neighbours. 
We wanted the game to be visually appealing and inviting. This is why we focused on large, easily accessible buttons, eye-grabbing text and graphics.

This placed 3rd in the University of Calgary hackathon!
